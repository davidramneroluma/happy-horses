# happy-horses

Welcome to the happy horses workshop!

### **Getting started:**

`npm i`

`npm run test` --> should pass!
##
### **GOAL:**
Make the code nice. *(it makes the horses happy)*

### **Even more important GOAL:**
Collaborate, communicate and reason with your pardner. *(paddock harmony)*
##
### Rules
- Only touch the code in index.js (don't touch test.js, data.json, database.js. Adding packages to package.json is OK)

- Extracting code to other files is OK.

- `npm run test` --> should pass after refactor!

##

That's it! May the happiest horses win! *(it's not a competition)*
